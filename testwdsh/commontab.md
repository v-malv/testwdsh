Option  |Type  |Description
------------- | ------------- |------------- |
defaultMergeOption|	String|	Specifies how to merge the results of queries with locally cached data. This can be set to a value of msls.MergeOption.
disableUrlScreenParameters|	Boolean|	Specifies whether a primary key is used to form the URL for a screen instance. The bookmarking feature for HTML client screens enables a user to copy the URL for a specific screen instance and return to that instance later. The URL is partially based on the primary key for the screenâ€™s entity, so if the primary key contains sensitive information you may want to prevent users from seeing it by disabling the bookmarking feature.
enableModalScrollRegions|	Boolean|	Indicates whether to use an independent scroll region inside modal views such as dialog boxes and pickers. If this option isn't enabled, modal views will expand to their full size, allowing the user to scroll in the main browser window to see all the content. This option works better with some devices.
showContentBehindDialog|	Boolean|	Indicates whether the background screen behind a dialog box should be visible. This has no effect on small devices, because a dialog box always uses the entire display. Hiding the background screen on large devices may improve performance.
transitionAnimationLevel|	String|	Specifies the level of animation that occurs during transitions. A simple animation can improve performance on some devices. This option can be set to a value of msls.TransitionAnimationLevel.
